    <p>India made history by winning the T20 World Cup 2024, their second title after lifting the trophy in 2007. The tournament's final was a thrilling encounter against South Africa, held at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.

     India's batting prowess, led by Virat Kohli's exceptional 76, set a challenging target for the Proteas. South Africa made a valiant effort to chase down the total, but India's bowlers, especially Hardik Pandya, defended their score brilliantly. The victory brought immense joy to the billion-plus Indian cricket fans and solidified India's position as a dominant force in T20 cricket.</p>
